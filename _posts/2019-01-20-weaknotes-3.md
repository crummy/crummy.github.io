First week at the new job is done. Three days of intros and meetings and trying to remember names, then two days
on-site with a client. I always enjoy getting a new laptop and setting it up just right, but Friday discovered
we'd have to work inside Windows VMs to be able to access this customer's intranet. Oh well.

* Watched _The Breaker-Upperers_, which was very funny though the drama seemed a little forced. 
* Trying to get our finances in order, I set up [Firefly III](https://firefly-iii.org/), a self-hosted finance
manager. Seems to work pretty well so far, there's a way to access most banks via a shared API called Spectre.
The whole point is to be able to answer questions about our money (e.g. how much do we spend on X) but coming up
with a categorization/tagging system is difficult when you don't really know what questions you'll want to ask
in the future. There are similar problems in software architecture.
* Don't know what my superpower is but my inability to remember names is definitely my superweakness.
