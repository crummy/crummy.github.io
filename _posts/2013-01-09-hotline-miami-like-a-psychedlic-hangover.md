There are plenty of video games that match the bullet points on an imagined box for Hotline Miami. Plenty of senseless killing, fast action, gratuitous violence &#8211; it sounds like just another game action game, so why does it feel so different? It&#8217;s hard to rave about the game without using phrases that are so overused they just sound generic (heart-pounding, gripping), but I think they are accurate.

On the other hand, the game also is very effective at making me feel&#8230; gross? Like a fever dream hangover, the low-fi 80s aesthetic and alternately dream-scene-like then high-tempo music create an effect that is, at the least, disconcerting. First, IÂ [load up the game to this music][1]. Then begin play, entering a wild[ frenzy of violence][2]. Last &#8211; and what an excellent design choice this is &#8211; once I&#8217;ve slaughtered every being in the level, [I return through the carnage that you&#8217;ve created to my car, with music like the end of a bad trip playing][3].

Hotline Miami plunges me into violence, making it so urgent and exciting that I lose sight of the brutality of it all, and then abruptly slaps me in the face to wake me up to it all, walking through the horrors I&#8217;ve created &#8211; did I really do all this? All these bodies, I remember running through these corridors and attacking and dying and attacking but it&#8217;s a shock to be confronted with it. I&#8217;m disturbed in a way I haven&#8217;t felt before.

The game is couched with a vague, drug-inspired storyline &#8211; the player receives vague phone calls asking him to kill everyone at a certain location, and eventually he is lead to the source of the calls &#8211; but I must admit it was difficult to follow for me and I ended up paying little attention to it. Instead, I recommend just sinking into the hazy, suffocating aesthetic of neon lights and pulsating electronic music, and experiencing the violent synesthesia that is Hotline Miami.
