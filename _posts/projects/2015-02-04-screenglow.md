I wanted to work on my Windows programming and C++, so I turned my Python [Ambihue](wp/ambient-light-controller/145/) program into a more fully feautured GUI app, with persistent settings and a taskbar icon and everything. Digging into win32 APIs for screengrabs hurt my brain, though. The project is [on Github](https://github.com/crummy/screenglow).
