I used [Splitwise](wp/splitwise-your-bills-and-friends/128/) at work to make bill paying easier at lunch, but with large groups it could get complicated to tell who owed the most. I wrote an app that would take your Splitwise login via OAuth, get your list of friends, and would tell you who owed the most out of those at lunch. Developed a prototype.
