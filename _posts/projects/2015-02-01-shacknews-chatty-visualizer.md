A force based visualization of the tree graph made by posts in the Shacknews forum system. I made this for my data visualization class and was voted best visualization. I ended up giving a talk on force based visualizations in my technical writing class as a result of this project. More details are available in the [blog post I wrote about the project](/wp/shacknews-chatty-visualiser/60/).
