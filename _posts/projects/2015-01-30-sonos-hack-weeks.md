Several times a year, Sonos hosted hack weeks where employees could spend time working on any project they could think of, as long as it was Sonos related. 

The results are largely unsuitable for public consumption, but a list of the projects I worked on are here:

* PA software, to record audio from a computer and broadcast it to a Sonos component
* Google Music API for Sonos
* [Phillips Hue API for Sonos](/wp/control-your-phillips-hue-lights-with-sonos/139/)
* Gesture based controller interface mockup for iOS
* Controller UI colour scheme driven by album art
* Sonos dashboard showing track info, Jira bugs, Google Analytics data
