Currently, immediate access to commonly used apps on Android is not so immediate, so I'm working on a gesture-based lock screen. Easily-memorized gestures help users rapidly select a number of applications directly from the moment they wake their phone. It's currently in a prototype form only, with [development on Github](www.github.com/crummy/draglauncher).
