The day I found out I was going to UCSC was one of the most disappointing days of my life. I had planned for years to go to UCSB, and when they turned me down it meant leaving all my friends, my family, and various other plans for a place I&#8217;d never even been to. As move-in day neared I talked to a few friends who had been there who made me feel better, and the campus seemed cool when I visited for orientation, but it was still with a strong sense of trepidation and regret that I packed all my stuff up and left Santa Barbara.

It&#8217;s funny looking back on that because I feel like I came so close to never coming here. Turns out I had challenging but interesting classes, a beautiful campus, and it wasn&#8217;t even as cold as I feared. More than anything though, my first year was defined by sixth floor Porter. I felt such a tight knit sense of community with everyone, playing nightly LoL in between eating at/complaining about the dining hall, partying with two buck chuck, going on night hikes, and generally feeling like part of a massive eccentric family.

If it wasn&#8217;t for all my friends leaving I would have stayed in the dorms a second year, but instead I moved into the Redwood Grove apartments with a few ex-Porter friends. I was worried that without the forced social interaction of the dorms things wouldn&#8217;t be the same, but having ones own living room makes board games or socializing or just relaxing a lot easier and I&#8217;ve loved my living situation. Though this is probably in no small part due to my excellent luck in flatmates!

UCSC gave me the friends and camaraderie and belonging that I kind of expected from tertiary education but never got. For me that was the more valuable than the knowledge or degree that is supposed to be I attended, and it&#8217;s certainly what will define my memories of being here.

I just signed up for my last quarter&#8217;s classes and already I feel the dread of leaving, wondering if I should double major or get a masters or just fail a require class, anything to stay here longer&#8230; But I remember how sad I was to leave Santa Barbara and how unexpectedly awesome that turned out and it makes me feel a bit better about whatever is around the next corner.
