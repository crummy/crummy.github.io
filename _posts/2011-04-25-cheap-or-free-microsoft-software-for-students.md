If you're a student, you can get a bunch of software from Microsoft for significantly lower prices. The idea is that if Microsoft can get students to use the software, they'll go out into the industry with those skills, leading to companies purchasing more MS software.

### Dreamspark

If you're a current student with a .edu email address in the United States, you can get free copies of software from [www.dreamspark.com][1] such as:

  * [Visual Studio 2010 Professional][2]
  * [Windows Server 2008 R2][3]
  * [Expression Studio 4 Ultimate][4]

You'll need to [sign in][5] to any Windows Live account, then click Get Verified on the left. After entering your .edu email address and some additional information, you'll have access to the download.

### The Ultimate Steal

At [The Ultimate Steal][6] the software's not free, but it's considerably cheaper than buying elsewhere. Again, you'll need a .edu email address. Here's what they're offering:

  * Office 2010 Academic for $79.95 (compare to [$395][7] for equivalent)
  * Windows 7 Professional Upgrade for $29.99 (compare to [$168][8] for equivalent)

It's worth noting that in many cases [you can use Windows 7 Upgrade even if you're not upgrading][9]; as if it was the full non-upgrade version.

### MSDNAA

Lastly, if your school is part of the [MSDN Academic Alliance][10] program, definitely check it out. At my school it's available only to students in the College of Engineering, but if you can gain access you might be able to get free copies of Windows 7, Office, and similar software.
