I spent a large amount of time wandering the indie game section of PAX, checking out the widely varied games and chatting to developers. One that especially caught my eye was Brendon Chung&#8217;s new title, [Quadrilateral Cowboy][1]. I&#8217;d heard about it via the Idle Thumbs panel earlier that day, and had played a couple of his previous titles; [Atom Zombie Smasher][2] and [Thirty Flights of Loving][3] most recently, so I was eager to play, and was not disappointed.

The game involves breaking-and-entering high security locations with the aid of various technical devices. A player may approach a door, place a computer on the ground, and type commands on a virtual DOS prompt; telnetting into the door to open it briefly, allowing the player to slip through. Eventually the player will be writing small scripts commandeering a sequence of security systems, redirecting a camera for a few seconds, opening a door, and then disabling a laser triggered alarm.

I often lack patience with stealth games in this vein, but Quadrilateral Cowboy handles failure well. In the in-game world, you&#8217;re actually walking through an abstract simulator of the target building, and so mistiming a camera disable just means walking out of its radius and trying again &#8211; essentially you are providing instructions (and scripts) for a theoretical agent who would actually be stealing the documents or whatever you are tasked with.

The &#8220;simulator&#8221; narrative also provides a sensible explanation for the wild visual style. Chung&#8217;s previous games have always exhibited an abstract style that I find difficult to draw comparisons to &#8211; usually games that don&#8217;t aim for a realistic art style are easily described with an analogy; XIII looks like a comic, Team Fortress 2 looks like a cartoon, etc. Brendon explained to me this is his interpretation of a lo-fi, low-poly 3D world, and though he spoke self-deprecatingly about his artistic talent I think it&#8217;s a great example of how a simple unique art style can be so effective.

It was great to play the game in such an early state, and despite having to receive a significant bit of help as I stumbled through the simulator I&#8217;m eagerly awaiting the final release, which hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to play next year.
