After being briefly interested in Spec Ops: The Line thanks to its unusual setting in desert-reclaimed Dubai I promptly forgot about it until strong recommendations started popping up on Twitter.

I think the lack of knowledge about the game going into really helped it succeed for me; Spec Ops: The Line came off as a wolf in sheeps clothing. Later I found out the developers had some pretty high goals they were trying to achieve but the game starts out slowly, with a very familiar scene to most gamers &#8211; third person cover shooter, hardened military bros bantering back and forth; the usual.

As you progress through the story though things gradually get a little interesting. There&#8217;s a choice early on (save a friend or save the hostages) that hints at what is to come, where things get a whole lot morally dubious. Civilians get involved in a way that I don&#8217;t recall seeing before in other shooters, and the psychological and physical toll of war becomes visible on your squad. Pay attention to the &#8220;tips&#8221; you see on load screens and you&#8217;ll see weird commentary or explanations of psychological disorders.

Halfway through I decided that this is the first game I&#8217;ve played that is actually about war. This may seem odd in a world filled with shooters set in war but Spec Ops: The Line made me think about what it is actually like to be a soldier in a way that other titles haven&#8217;t gone anywhere near.

The writing is cheesy at times and I&#8217;ll repeat that the actual gameplay is nothing to write home about, but all the same I&#8217;d recommend anyone interested in storytelling in games to play Spec Ops: The Line. It&#8217;s important for pushing the boundaries of what is possible with storytelling in a big budget action game and I look forward to what Yager Development does in the future.
