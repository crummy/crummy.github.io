I can&#8217;t really remember where I came upon it, but somehow I ended up with a pretty fascinating iPhone app called [Chromatic Vision Simulator][1]. It&#8217;s a very simple app that utilises the camera &#8211; point it at something colourful, select a variety of colourblindness, and you&#8217;ll see the colour-limited version on screen. It does it job without any fuss and even features a few nice side-by-side comparisons.

The image above, a screen grab from the program, shows true colour on the right and protanope vision on the left, which is what I have &#8211; commonly known as red/green colourblind. The two images look pretty much identical to me, though if I toggle between the other two types of colourblindness I can see a large difference, especially tritanope which looks just about black and white.

Anyway, the app hasn&#8217;t really helped me figure out what I&#8217;ve been missing out on, which people often ask me about (it&#8217;s impossible for me to know!) but it does allow easy insight for others into what I see. I feel like there must be other ways technology can ease understanding between people.
