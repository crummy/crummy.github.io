I'm on a road trip from Santa Barbara to Portland, which should be the best time to write but the drive has given me writer's cramp.

Instead, I made Connect 4 in Python, using Pygame, to refresh my Python knowledge. It only took a few hours, possibly thanks to Connect 4 being about the simplest game possible. It's about 150 lines of code and half of that is my inefficient victory-checking code.
