I have two projects due this week and two midterms next week so all I'm going to say is: Go see [The Cabin in the Woods][1]. It's a non-traditional horror movie, and I hardly like horror movies at all. That's all the detail I want to get into because it's really a movie you should go see with as few expectations as possible.

One thing I will say about it: It reminds me a bit of Community (a show I apparently should have been watching a long time ago) in that it's story is told by context. My favourite Community episodes are the ones that are homages to particular genres or shows (the Law & Order one especially), and Cabin in the Woods draws on all other horror movies similarly: it's a horror movie about horror movies.

If you're anyone, you'll love this movie, and if you like horror movies I'm sure you'll enjoy it even more.
